# **Responsive Portfolio**

## **Overview**

A portfolio serves a port between a developer and a potential employer or anyone intrested in it. There is an 'About me" section where the developer writtes about  him/her self. There is also a  contact form where one is able to reach out to the developer. The developes projects are all listed in a section, ready to be accessed.
Making a portfolio responsive lets the viewer see a portfolio on a desktop, ipad or phone with the perfect layout in all devices by addapting to the browser and chaging its size accordingly.
