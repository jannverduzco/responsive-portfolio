                            <p> Hello! My name is Janneth. I was born in Mexico but moved to America when I was
                                9
                                years
                                of age. I started 4th grade in Texas, San Antonio to be specific, and I have been
                                here
                                ever since. In middle school I struggled with the language given that I was
                                starting to be part of complex conversations with out undestading them completely.
                                I
                                soon
                                got over that hurtle becauase I made sure to strictly speak English with my group
                                of
                                friends. As the years went by I went from elementary school to middle school and
                                then to
                                graduate from high school.
                                I attended a comunity college and then university, both localy. I graduated from
                                The
                                University of Texas at San Antonio with a Biology Degree. I used my degree to
                                focus
                                on
                                clinical trials. Four years post-graduation I am a stay home mom to a
                                11-month-old.
                                Web
                                development was never in my radar but after experiencing motherhood I wanted a
                                career
                                with much more flexibility as to where I could work from and my future seemed
                                much
                                brighter when I picured myself choosing web development. </p>


                            <p>I am currently in a web development program learning to design the front and back
                                end
                                of
                                a website using HTML, CSS and Javascript, hence a full stack course. Although
                                the
                                class
                                is extremly challenging and fastpaced, given that it's a bootcamp, it is
                                fascinating
                                and
                                as hard as it is really something to look foward to.
                            </p>

                            <p> I plan to devote time, effort and sweat even, to my journey as a web developer
                                starting
                                with this program. I look foward to obtaining, practicing, practicing and
                                practicing
                                the
                                infomation I am learning in this course and hopefully get a great opportunity at
                                a
                                job.
