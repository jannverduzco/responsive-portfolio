                            <p> Hello! My name is Janneth. I was born in Mexico but moved to America when I was 9 years
                                of age. I started 4th grade in Texas, San Antonio to be specic, and I have been here
                                ever since. I picked up the language pretty quickly until I hit 7th grade. I was
                                starting to have more complex conversations and needed a much larger vocabulary. I soon
                                got over that hump becuase I made sure to strictly speak English with my group of
                                friends. As the years went by I went form elementary school to middle school and then to
                                graduate from high school.
                                I attended a comunity college and then university, both localy. I graduated from The
                                University of Texas at San Antonio with a Biology Degree. I used my degree to focus on
                                clinical trials. Four years post-graduation I am a stay home mom to a 11-month-old. Web
                                development was never in my radar but after experiencing motherhood I wanted a career
                                with much more flexibility as to where I could work from and my future seemed much
                                brighter when I picured myself choosing web development. </p>


                            <p>I am currently in a web development program learning to design the front and back end of
                                a website using HTML, CSS and Javascript, hence a full stack course. Although the class
                                is extremly challenging and fastpaced, given that it's a bootcamp, it is fascinating and
                                as hard as it is really something to look foward to.
                            </p>

                            <p> I plan to devote time, effort and sweat even, to my journey as a web developer starting
                                with this program. I look foward to obtaining, practicing, practicing and practicing the
                                infomation I am learning in this course and hopefully get a great opportunity at a job.
                            </p>
